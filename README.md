***CLOWN DESCRIPTION***

Hi guys, CaptainBeluga here. Ever heard about Soap#1382 (he is a clown 🤡), also known for his agency called Axiom Inc.

He defines himself like an engineer, but he can't even code in html.


# ***AMAZING PROJECT***

He also speaks about his projects. One of them impressed me a lot.
"My engineers team (me included) is working for a new chatgpt without limitations".
It can be an huge idea, if only he known code 🤣.



# ***NO WORDS TO DESCRIBE THIS SHIT***

Btw, we asked him for a partnership to expand our customers.
Here his response:

As you can see, his english is really professional. But what can happen if I ask to chatgpt if the message was generated by the AI?

# ***DID SOAP#1382 SKIDDED ASTRO?***

Yeah of course he did.
Let's talk about Hydra-Multitool. Yeah very nice, but it's a mix of skidded programs by Axiom Inc 🤮🤮🤮. The main source code was taken from us.
You'll probably don't believe me, but let me show you something.

LOL, in the second image you can see Hydra, after the accident 🤣🤣. Joking a side, what is this shit 🤣.
In the first picture you can see [@astros3x](https://github.com/astros3x/) perfect Ascii Art 💪💪💪



Look now at Hydra source code 🤣. He didn't change the functions name. Also the colours,the input style and the structure of the software are identical.

# ***YE BUT.... HOW MUCH IS HYDRA SHIT?***

Guys, you can buy his skidded Hydra Shit Multitool for 60€ on his website. But I warn you, the tools he provides are skidded too lmao 🤣 + they're old and patched.
So you can waste 60€, or use them to buy the VIP VERSION of the best Multitool on the internet (which basic version offers a lot and that's free) => [⭐ASTRI MULTITOOL⭐](https://github.com/astros3x/Astri)

We know that the source code of AstroV1 is open, but at least do not resell it for 60€ come on!


# ***CARDING BUNDLE***
Exactly, Engineer Soap#1382 hitted again. He skidded a 'powerful' carding bundle. This time, 💩 the tiny shit 💩, stole an incredibile LoGiN SyStEm.
Let me show you 🤣🤣🤣

<img src="https://github.com/CaptainBeluga/soap-clown/blob/main/img/engineer.png" alt="input">

Look, the graphic part is something of amazing. But will it work fine right? Right?? RIGHT??? Of course NO 🤣, because as I said, he can't code 😏.
Btw, you have to pay for this shit, but you can create an account to use it for free 🧠🧠🧠. Big Brain of an Engineer ( E in uppercase() ).
The credentials save is something of incredible.

<img src="https://github.com/CaptainBeluga/soap-clown/blob/main/img/best_login_system.png" alt="input">

Yeah, a plain text file where your password is clearly readable 🧠😏
Almost I forgot, the terminal is still open (I thought he was an Engineer, not a Shitgineer 💩 🤣). But he's a soap 🧼🧼🧼, what would you expect???

The CC-GEN he stole has not Exception control. Look 🤣.

Apparently "Soap#1382" doesn't like SESSO_PAZZO and (apparently) HIS_MAMMA remains a CAGNA.

Now let's talk about "Bin-Breach". Another skidded tool. This tool sucks. Soap unlocks another skill.
He can't code, and he can't even skids 🤣. All the tools he skidded suck 😏.
TO END this agony, when you try to save the bins that pop up, the program crashes (of course 😏)

🚨👮🚨👮🚨👮 The 🧼 Soap 🧼 can be arrested for mass murder, because he killed a lot of engineers who accidentally saw the programs of "his" shitty 💩 "company". 🚨👮🚨👮🚨👮


Btw, I've warned you, now you have to choose. AHAHAH just kidding, do not pay these programs, download here [SHITTY HYDRA MULTITOOL](https://github.com/CaptainBeluga/soap-clown/releases/tag/shitty-hydra) and here [SHITTY CARDING BUNDLE](https://github.com/CaptainBeluga/soap-clown/releases/tag/shitty-carding)
