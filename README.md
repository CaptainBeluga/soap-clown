***CLOWN DESCRIPTION***

Hi guys, CaptainBeluga here. Ever heard about Soap#1382 (he is a clown 🤡), also known for his agency called Axiom Inc.

He defines himself like an engineer, but he can't even code in html.


# ***AMAZING PROJECT***

He also speaks about his projects. One of them impressed me a lot.
"My engineers team (me included) is working for a new chatgpt without limitations".
It can be an huge idea, if only he knows code 🤣.



# ***NO WORDS TO DESCRIBE THIS SHIT***

Btw, we asked him for a partnership to expand our customers.
Here his response:

As you can see, his english is really professional. But what can happen if I ask to chatgpt if the message was generated by the AI?

# ***DID SOAP#1382 SKIDDED ASTRO?***

Yeah of course he did.
Let's talk about Hydra-Multitool. Yeah very nice, but it's a mix of skidded programs by Axiom Inc 🤮🤮🤮. The main source code was taken from us.
You'll probably don't believe me, but let me show you something.

LOL, on the right you can see Hydra, after the accident 🤣🤣. Joking a side, what is this shit 🤣
On the left you can see [@astros3x](https://github.com/astros3x/) perfect Ascii Art 💪💪💪



Look now at Hydra source code 🤣. He didn't change the functions name. Also the colours,the input style and the structure of the software are identical.

# ***YE BUT.... HOW MUCH IS HYDRA SHIT?***

Guys, you can buy his skidded Hydra Shit Multitool for 60€ on his website. But I warn you, the tools he provides are skidded too lmao 🤣 + they're old and patched.
So you can waste 60€, or use them to buy the VIP VERSION of the best Multitool on the internet (which basic version offers a lot and that's free) => [⭐ASTRI MULTITOOL⭐](https://github.com/astros3x/Astri)

We know that the source code of AstroV1 is open, but at least do not resell it for 60€ come on!

Btw, I advise you, now you have to choose. AHAHAH just kidding, do not pay it, download it here [SHITTY HYDRA MULTITOOL](https://github.com/CaptainBeluga/soap-clown/releases/tag/shitty-hydra) (yeah the software has not system security features to check if u pay or not, because like I said, Soap can't code 🤣🤣🤣)

Thanks for your attention, we wait you on our discord server 😏
